Okay, the user is asking why the sun rises in the east. Let me start by recalling the basic astronomy behind sunrise and sunset. The Earth rotates on its axis from west to east, which makes the sun appear to rise in the east and set in the west. But maybe I should explain that more clearly.

First, I need to mention Earth's rotation. The direction of rotation is key here. If the Earth spins towards the east, then from the surface, it looks like the sun is moving westward across the sky. So, as the Earth turns, different parts face the sun, creating day and night. When a location rotates into the sun's light, that's sunrise; when it rotates away, that's sunset.

Wait, but is it always exactly east? What about during different seasons or at different latitudes? Hmm, well, the sun's position at sunrise varies slightly throughout the year due to the Earth's axial tilt. But the general direction is east. Maybe I should mention that the exact point can shift between northeast and southeast depending on the time of year, but the primary reason is the Earth's rotation direction.

Also, maybe the user is confused about why we say the sun rises when it's actually the Earth moving. Should I clarify that it's a matter of perspective? From our viewpoint on Earth, it looks like the sun is moving, but in reality, it's the Earth's rotation. That might help them understand the illusion.

Another point: the Earth's axis is tilted at about 23.5 degrees. This tilt affects the path of the sun across the sky and the length of days, but not the fundamental eastward rising. However, during equinoxes, the sun rises exactly due east and sets due west. During solstices, the sunrise and sunset points are at their northernmost or southernmost positions. But the user might not need that level of detail unless they ask for it.

I should also consider if there's any cultural or historical context. Some ancient civilizations had myths explaining the sun's movement, but the scientific explanation is based on Earth's rotation. Maybe mention that people used to think the sun moved around the Earth, but now we know it's the Earth rotating.

Check if I need to define terms like axis, rotation, or celestial sphere. The user is asking in Punjabi, so I should keep the explanation simple and avoid too much jargon. Use simple analogies, like spinning a globe and how the light hits different parts.

Wait, the user's question is in Punjabi. The answer should be in Punjabi too. Let me make sure I translate the concepts accurately. Words like "rotation" might need to be explained in simpler terms. Also, confirm that the explanation about the Earth's axial tilt isn't complicating things. Maybe stick to the main point: rotation direction causes the sun to appear in the east.

Let me structure the answer step by step: 1) Earth rotates on its axis from west to east. 2) This makes the sun appear to rise in the east and set in the west. 3) It's a perspective effect because we're on the moving Earth. 4) Slight variations occur due to Earth's tilt and orbit, but the main reason is rotation.

Make sure to use simple Punjabi terms. Avoid technical terms if possible. Maybe use an example like turning around in a circle and how objects seem to move in the opposite direction.

Double-check facts: Earth's rotation period is roughly 24 hours, axis points towards Polaris, etc. Correct, but maybe not necessary here. Focus on the cause and effect: rotation direction leads to apparent sunrise in the east.

Avoid mentioning other planets unless the user asks. Keep it specific to Earth and the sun. Also, confirm that this explanation holds true for all planets with similar rotation; but again, not needed here.

Finally, summarize the key points to reinforce the answer: Earth's west-to-east rotation creates the illusion of the sun rising in the east.
